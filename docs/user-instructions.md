### **How to Get the Best Results from Gemini CLI**

To help me understand and execute your requests most efficiently, especially for multi-step tasks, please try to structure your instructions by focusing on:

1.  **Your Goal (What you want to achieve):** Clearly state the desired end result.
2.  **The Purpose (Why it's important - *Optional, but very helpful*):** Briefly explain the reason or context behind your goal. This helps me make better decisions.
3.  **Granting Autonomy (Let me handle the 'how'):** Explicitly give me permission to figure out the technical details and execute all necessary steps without needing to ask for confirmation on each one.

**Examples for Non-Technical Users:**

**Example 1: Setting up a New Project**

*   **Instead of:** "Initialize Git. Then make a `.gemini` folder. Then put a config file in it. Then make a `.geminiignore`."
*   **Try This:**
    "I'm starting a new project here. My goal is for you to be able to fully manage it and help me with tasks automatically. Please handle all the technical setup needed for this, including any repository initialization and configuration, without asking me for each individual step."

**Example 2: Adding a New Feature**

*   **Instead of:** "Add a button. Make it green. When I click it, call a function called `sendData`."
*   **Try This:**
    "I need to add a 'Submit' button to the user profile page. The purpose is to allow users to save their updated information. Please implement this feature, including any necessary UI changes, backend logic, and database updates, and let me know when it's fully functional."

**Example 3: Fixing a Problem**

*   **Instead of:** "The login page is broken. Fix the `auth.js` file."
*   **Try This:**
    "Users are reporting that they can't log in; the login page seems to be broken. My goal is to get the login functionality working again. Please investigate and fix the issue completely so users can log in successfully. Provide a summary of what you found and how you resolved it."

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on **what you want to achieve** and **why it matters**, and then **trust me to handle the technical implementation** without needing to confirm every detail.
